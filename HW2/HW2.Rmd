cumulative=select(cumulative, -n)

### Plot the cumulative percent positivity of tests of Parish on a map for the weeks containing dates 
#### March 22, 2020 (stay at home order starts)
```{r}

## Q5
### new cases by lab collection date with a 7-day average line of New Orleans
```{r}
caseno=filter(Daily_counts, Parish=="Orleans")

  mutate(sevendayaverage1=rollmean(Daily_Case_Count, k=7, fill=NA))

  geom_col(alpha = 0.5, fill = "blue")+
  labs(title = "new cases by lab collection date of New Orleans", x = "Lab Collection Date", y = "New Cases")
```

### new cases by lab collection date with a 7-day average line of Baton Rouge 
```{r}
casebr=filter(Daily_counts, Parish=="East Baton Rouge")
casebr=casebr %>%
  mutate(sevendayaverage2=rollmean(Daily_Case_Count, k=7, fill=NA))
ggplot(data = casebr, mapping = aes(x=Lab_Collection_Date, y=Daily_Case_Count))+
  geom_line(data = casebr, mapping = aes(x = Lab_Collection_Date, y = sevendayaverage2, group = 1), color = "purple", size =1)+
  geom_col(alpha = 0.5, fill = "orange")+
  labs(title = "new cases by lab collection date of Baton Rouge", x = "Lab Collection Date", y = "New Cases")
```

### Findings
```{r}
# In New Orleans, new cases started to increase rapidly since March and peaked in April. A big drop after stay home order was lifted. Even though there were fluctuations in the new cases since May, the numbers are much lower than March's and April's numbers. Baton Rouge has an opposite tendency. In Baton Rouge, new cases started to increase rapidly since July when mask became mandate, but started to slowly decrease since August.
